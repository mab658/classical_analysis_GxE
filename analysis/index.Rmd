Welcome to my research website.

## Project overview
The purpose of this project is to gain some insights in using classical statistical methods in the analysis of multi-environment data. The principal objectives are outlined as follow:

1. To identify stable and high-yielding cassava clones adapted to broad and/or specific environments

2. To determine the relative importance of sources of variation influencing key agronomic traits; and

3. To identify mega environments for Nigerian cassava

4. Finally, we sought to provide a clear road map for other researchers in pursuing these objectives
